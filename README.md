## Updated daily :alarm_clock:

### Prerequisites

A [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) account is recommended to save progress and solutions on the platform. Otherwise, a guest account is also available on HackerRank to run the code.

## Running the code 

Simply copy, paste and run the code if running on HackerRank.

If running locally, then: 

* clone the repo ```git clone https://github.com/mughees-asif/hackerrank-solved-challenges.git```

* change directory ```cd hackerrank-solved-challenges``` 

* Run ```Main.java``` with your Java compiler or run the ```main``` method in ```Main.java``` if using an IDE.

## Contributing

Everyone is more than welcome to contribute to the solutions.

### Set-up for [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows):
1. From the main menu, choose VCS | Get from Version Control, or, if no project is currently opened, click Get from Version Control on the Welcome screen.

2. In the Get from Version Control dialog, specify the URL of the remote repository you want to clone (you can click Test to make sure that connection to the remote can be established), or select one of the VCS hosting services on the left. If you are already logged in to the selected hosting service, completion will suggest the list of available repositories that you can clone.

3. Click Clone. If you want to create a IntelliJ IDEA project based on the sources you have cloned, click Yes in the confirmation dialog. Git root mapping will be automatically set to the project root directory.

4. Optimise or add a different approach to the same solution.

5. Initiate a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

6. I will review it and, if applicable, merge the pull request.
